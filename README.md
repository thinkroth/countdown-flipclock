#Overview

While really neat, this thing only works on the latest stable chrome build with GPU Accelerated Compositing enabled. To turn this on, simply navigate to
"about:flags" in Chrome, turn on the compositing, then restart Chrome. You can then get the clock bit working by typing a URL like:

    index.html?date=2011-10-28&what=My Birthday

And you should see flip clock goodness. Keep in mind that this was something I whipped up to display on a TV, so it's not super-robust. Anyway, the concept is
cool and I thought I'd throw this up there for people to see :)
